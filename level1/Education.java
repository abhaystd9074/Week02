// Educational Course Hierarchy
// Description: Model a course system where Course is the base class, OnlineCourse is a subclass, and PaidOnlineCourse extends OnlineCourse.
// Tasks:
// Define a superclass Course with attributes like courseName and duration.
// Define OnlineCourse to add attributes such as platform and isRecorded.
// Define PaidOnlineCourse to add fee and discount.
// Goal: Demonstrate how each level of inheritance builds on the previous, adding complexity to the system.
